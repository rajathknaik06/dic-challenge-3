"""Noah, a global analyst at a demographic research firm, has been tasked with identifying which country experienced the largest population growth over a two-year period. He has a dataset where each entry consists of a country code and its population figures for two consecutive years. Noah needs to determine which country had the highest increase in population and present the result in a specific format. 



Help Noah by writing a program that outputs the country code with the largest population increase, along with the increase itself.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the number of countries.

Each of the following N blocks contains three lines:

The first line is a country code.
The second line is an integer representing the population of the country in the first year.
The third line is an integer representing the population of the country in the second year.
Output format :
The output displays the country code and the population increase in the format {code: difference}, where code is the country code and difference is the increase in population."""

# Reading number of countries
N = int(input())

# Initialize a dictionary to store the population data
population_data = {}

# Process each country's data
for _ in range(N):
    # Read country code
    country_code = input()
    # Read populations for two years
    year1_population = int(input())
    year2_population = int(input())
    
    # Calculate the increase in population
    increase = year2_population - year1_population
    
    # Store the increase in the dictionary
    population_data[country_code] = increase

# Find the country code with the largest increase
max_increase_country = max(population_data, key=population_data.get)
max_increase_value = population_data[max_increase_country]

# Print the country code with the largest increase in population in the format {code: difference}
print(f"{{{max_increase_country}:{max_increase_value}}}")
